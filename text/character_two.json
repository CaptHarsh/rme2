  "text": "YOU: Hey Harsh, I've heard Mihir has been working on some interesting projects lately. Can you tell me more about them? HARSH: Absolutely! Mihir's project portfolio is quite diverse and impressive. First off, he developed a movie ticket booking system, which streamlined the process of booking tickets online. It was a hit among moviegoers and theater owners alike. Then, he ventured into e-commerce with a website that offered a seamless shopping experience to users. But here's where things get really interesting - Mihir came up with a unique project called Woofr, a dog dating mobile app. Yes, you heard it right! It's like Tinder for dogs, connecting furry friends for playdates and companionship. And that's not all - currently, Mihir is diving deep into cybersecurity with a new firewall project. He's also working on a script to bypass honeypots, which shows his ingenuity in tackling complex security challenges. YOU: Wow, Mihir's projects sound incredibly innovative and diverse. Thanks for sharing, Harsh! HARSH: No problem at all! Mihir always keeps things exciting with hisÂ projects."
